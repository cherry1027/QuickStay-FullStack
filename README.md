I developed a fully functional Hotel Booking Web Application using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The platform allows users to browse hotels, check availability, book rooms, and securely complete payments online.
To implement authentication, I integrated Clerk for user login and registration. Clerk’s pre-built UI components such as Sign-In, Sign-Up, and User Profile helped me create a seamless and secure user authentication experience.
The system also includes email notifications. Every time a user successfully books a hotel room, they instantly receive an automatic booking confirmation email.
For handling online payments, I integrated Stripe, enabling users to securely pay the hotel charges directly through the platform.
In addition to the user side, I built an admin dashboard where admins can add new hotel rooms, update listings, and manage all hotel bookings.
After completing the development, I deployed the entire MERN application on Vercel for smooth and reliable production hosting.
